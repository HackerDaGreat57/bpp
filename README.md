# Blender++
A *somewhat experimental* C++ application. The project was created in order to let people have the freedom to do whatever they want, with no limitations or restrictions, without having to pay a single penny to anyone. But this will only happen once it gets mature enough to actually make a difference. There's a long, **long** way to go until we reach that checkpoint, but I'm just doing what I can for now.

Apple Macintosh/Linux compatibility is planned but not guaranteed (for now). Make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/bpp/pulls) please!

## Current state of the project/development status
You can view Blender++'s [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/HackerDaGreat57/projects/2).

## Development
### Process
1. Clone the repository
2. Write code (lol)
3. Compile & test **thoroughly** to make sure your stuff works
4. Add binaries to `.gitignore`, if there are new binaries that aren't already ignored
5. **DO NOT COMMIT TO THE REPOSITORY!!!** Make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/bpp/pulls) instead, please.

## Why did you create this project?
This application is meant to replace all the overpriced proprietary software out there that doesn't give you any freedom. I believe that computer software was meant to be free and open, and some desperate people from 1969 ([yes, literally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software#Origin)) decided to unnecessarily close and monetize it. I know we all have to make a buck or two, but I really don't think software is the way to do that.

My stance on proprietary software is exactly the opposite of Bill Gates' opinion, including the hint of anger. Microsoft Windows is the only exception, but even that's only because over half of the world's personal computers are running it.

## The history of this project
If you look at the 42 repositories I currently have, they are either forks or baseless claims of greatness. These are the products of me not having enough time to work on them properly, but now that summer is over and my teachers are giving less homework I am able to actually get somewhere. I have wanted to build this app since 2019, but I never found enough time to do so until now.
