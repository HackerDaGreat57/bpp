# Blender++
An experimental C application that is meant to replace all the big dudes who sell software for $600 a year. (Hint: That company's name is a material that people used to make houses out of.)

## How to build from source 🛠️
Make sure you have the latest version of [`msys2`](https://www.msys2.org/) installed. Make sure the environment variable `MSYSPATH_BPP` is set to `{msys2 install dir}` Open [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode.git) and click `Terminal -> Run Task... -> Build Blender++ (for outsiders)`. **Once you ran the `(for outsiders)` script at least once (and let it finish) then you can use the regular `Build Blender++` task.**

Apple Macintosh/Linux compatibility planned but not guaranteed (for now).
