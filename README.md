# Blender++
A *somewhat experimental* C++ application that can do (well, is *supposed* to do) everything a computer is capable of. That means basically all the programs you currently have installed on your computer conveniently packed into one application. There's a long, **long** way to go until we reach that checkpoint, but I'm just doing what I can for now.

Apple Macintosh/Linux compatibility is planned but not guaranteed (for now). Make a PR please!

## Why did you create this project?
This application is meant to replace all the overpriced proprietary software out there that doesn't give you any freedom. I believe that computer software was meant to be free and open, and some desperate people from 1969 ([yes, literally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software#Origin)) decided to unnecessarily close and monetize it. I know we all have to make a buck or two, but I really don't think software is the way to do that.

My stance on proprietary software is exactly the opposite of Bill Gates' opinion, including the hint of anger. Microsoft Windows is the only exception, but even that's only because over half of the world's personal computers are running it.
