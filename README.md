# Blender++
An experimental C application that is meant to replace all the big dudes who sell software for $600 a year. (Hint: That company's name is a material that people used to make houses out of.)

## How to build from source 🛠️
**Make sure you have the latest version of `msys2` installed and its `/usr/bin` is in your PATH.** Open [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode.git) and click `Terminal -> Run Task... -> Build Blender++ (for outsiders)`

Apple Macintosh/Linux compatibility planned but not guaranteed (for now).
