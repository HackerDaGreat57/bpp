# Blender++
A multi-purpose free and open-source application that aims to (eventually) be a complete software suite which will replace all software on your computer except for your operating system and drivers. It's like a neat little toolbox that you can take apart and tinker with, just like the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) project.

## Platforms this project supports
We plan on world dominance. We **plan** to support Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, iPadOS, Java VM, and cloud-based JavaScript.

The ports for Windows and Linux are in this branch. The appropriate branch is linked for every other port.

### Windows (branch 'cpp')
* **Build method:** [`scripts/build.windows.bat`](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/bpp/blob/main/scripts/build.windows.bat)
* **Supported architecture(s):** `x86-64`, `x86-32`
* **Supported version(s):** Aiming for compatibility with at least Windows 7 x64 Service Pack 1 or later, but there is no guarantee.

### Linux (branch 'cpp')
Currently not supported, but planned. This version will be based on the Windows version codebase with some slight Linux-specific differences. We need help!

### Apple Devices (branch 'macos', 'ios', 'ipados', 'watchos', 'tvos')
macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS versions will all be based on Swift/SwiftUI (backend/frontend). No renderer options - only SwiftUI will be supported.

I have no Apple devices other than a 1st-generation iPhone SE and a 1st-generation Apple Watch, so this is mostly blank at the moment. If you want to help set up Apple ports, [go right ahead](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/bpp/pulls).

### Java (branch 'java')
This port will work wherever OpenJDK 1.19 works, using JavaFX/Swing/AWT/(OpenGL/Vulkan via `lwjgl3`) for the GUI. Under development.

### Android (branch 'android')
Under development.

### Online (branch 'live')
*Blender++ Live* will be written in JavaScript and React, and will match the feature set of all other versions. This port is meant for giving you a taste of Blender++ before you download, but it can be used as an online replacement.

## Current state of the project/development status
You can view Blender++'s [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/HackerDaGreat57/projects/2).

I would also like to point out that I will be traveling to a place with very slow Internet connection on September 14, and I will have time to code only after October 19 since I'll have lots of stuff to catch up on in the rest of my life. **There may be low activity during this time**, however I might get some time here and there to pitch in once in a while.

I'm sorry for trying to ditch GitHub, my friends. **The Gitea migration has been canceled.**

## Development
### Process
1. Clone the repository
2. Write code (lol)
3. Compile & test **thoroughly** to make sure your stuff works
4. Add binaries to [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/bpp/blob/main/.gitignore), if there are new binaries that aren't already ignored
5. Make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/bpp/pulls). Only trusted Collaborators will have push access to the repository, and everyone else always has Pull Request permissions.

### Map
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to edit the source code of the program, mainly because VS Code is the only editor apart from the real Visual Studio that has built-in IntelliSense. There is an [extention](https://github.com/wk-j/vscode-save-and-run) I have installed in VS Code that runs a Task every time my source code file is saved. That Task runs a Windows Batch File or Linux Shell Script that is responsible for setting up the build and calling GCC.

Since all the code of the program is in one file, I used a [bookmarks extention](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks) as well. It is configured to store bookmarks in [`.vscode/bookmarks.json`](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/bpp/blob/main/.vscode/bookmarks.json).

## Why did you create this project?
This application is meant to replace all the overpriced proprietary software out there that doesn't give you any freedom. I believe that computer software was meant to be free and open, and some desperate people from 1969 ([yes, literally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software#Origin)) decided to unnecessarily close and monetize it. I know we all have to make a buck or two, but I really don't think software is the way to do that.

My stance on proprietary software is exactly the opposite of Bill Gates' opinion, including the hint of anger. Microsoft Windows and Apple's operating systems are the only exceptions, but even that's only because over 60% of the world's personal computers are running them.

## The history of this project
If you look at the dozens of repositories I currently have, they are either forks or baseless claims of greatness. These are the products of me not having enough time to work on them properly, but now that summer is over and my teachers are giving less homework I am able to actually get somewhere. I have wanted to build this app since 2019, but I never found enough time to do so until now.
